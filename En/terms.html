            <h2>Terms of Services</h2>

            <p>Thank you for using bliro’s services (as defined below), a cloud-based digital meeting assistant that
                allows users to document their customer meetings and share information in different tools.</p>

            <p>To be eligible to register for a bliro account and use bliro’s services, you must review and accept the
                terms of this Agreement by clicking on the “I accept” button or other mechanism provided. By providing
                the data requested in the signup mask and clicking “I accept”, you make us an offer to enter into the
                Agreement based on these Terms. Before clicking “I accept”, you can review and modify the data entered
                in the signup mask by clicking on the relevant data field and making your modifications. We will confirm
                receipt of this offer by e-mail. This e-mail is not acceptance of your offer; we will accept the offer
                separately either by e-mail or by granting you access to the Bliro Services. Please review these terms
                carefully. By accepting these terms, you agree to these terms and conditions with Bliro GbR (“Bliro”).
                If you do not agree to be bound by these terms, you should not click the “I accept” button.
            </p>

            <p>In this agreement, “you,” “your” and “Customer” will refer to you. If you are registering for a bliro
                account or using the bliro Services on behalf of an entity or other organization, you are agreeing to
                these Terms for that entity or organization and representing to bliro that you have the authority to
                bind that entity or organization to these Terms (and, in which case, the terms “you”, “your” and
                “Customer” will refer to that entity or organization). The exception to this is if that organization has
                a separate contract with bliro covering one or more accounts and use of the Bliro Services, in which
                case that contract will govern the Bliro Services with respect to those accounts only.
            </p>

                        authority to do so; or d) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or
                        reference to the disclosing party’s Confidential Information.

                        thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice. If you are overdue on any payment and fail to pay
                        within ten (10) business days of a written notice of your overdue payment, then Bliro may assess

                        whatsoever, in accordance with applicable law. To the extent Bliro provides the Bliro Services
                        against a fee, Bliro warrants that it will, consistent with prevailing industry standards,

                        Service within a reasonable time period to be set by Customer (which must allow for at least
                        three attempts at rectification), Customer may claim a reduction in fees proportionate to the
                        defect (and claim a refund of any pre-paid fees exceeding the accordingly adjusted total) or
                        terminate the concerned Bliro Service(s) immediately by written notice, and shall be entitled to
                        receive a refund of any pre-paid Fees for unused Bliro Service access remaining during the term
                        of the concerned Bliro Service(s). Save for damage claims subject to the limitations of

                        of the limited warranty above.

                claim, loss, liability, proceeding, governmental investigation or enforcement action arising out of or
                relating to your activities under these Terms or your acts or omissions in connection with the provision
                of any Customer Content (“Claim”). Bliro and its affiliates will cooperate as fully as reasonably
                required in the defense of any Claim, at your expense. Bliro reserves the right, at your expense, to
                retain separate counsel for themselves in connection with any Claim or, if you have not responded
                reasonably to the applicable Claim, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any Claim in which
                you are a named party and that is otherwise subject to indemnification under this Section (to the extent
                permitted under applicable law, in particular the applicable laws, rules or code of civil procedure).
                You will pay all costs, reasonable attorneys’ fees and any settlement amounts or damages awarded against
                Bliro in connection with any Claim. You will also be liable to Bliro for any costs and attorneys’ fees
                Bliro incurs to successfully establish or enforce Bliro’s right to indemnification under this Section.

                    <h4>9.2 Termination and Suspension</h4>
                    <p>You may terminate your account at any time by sending an email to Bliro customer support
                        (hello@bliro.io). Bliro may terminate your account at any time with six (6) week’s notice;
                        provided that to the extent you have pre-paid any fees for a specific time period, such
                        termination for convenience will be effective no earlier than at the end of such pre-paid
                        period. Bliro furthermore may terminate or suspend your account in the event you commit any
                        material breach of any provision of these Terms and fail to fix that breach within five (5) days
                        after written notice of that breach. Bliro may also terminate or suspend your account
                        immediately for cause if: a) you violate (or give Bliro reason to believe you have violated) any
                        applicable law; b) there is reason to believe the traffic created from your use of the Bliro
                        Services or your use of the Bliro Services is fraudulent or negatively impacting the operating
                        capability of Bliro Services; c) Bliro determines, in its sole discretion, that providing the
                        Bliro Services is prohibited by law, or it has become impractical or unfeasible for any legal or
                        regulatory reason to provide the Bliro Services; or d) subject to applicable law, upon your
                        liquidation, commencement of dissolution proceedings, disposal of your assets or change of
                        control, a failure to continue business, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if you
                        become the subject of bankruptcy or similar proceeding. Either Party’s statutory right to
                        terminate this Agreement for good cause remains unaffected. If Bliro suspends your account,
                        Bliro will notify you accordingly. Note that no refund will be provided in the event of any
                        suspension or termination of your account for your breach.

                        that any terms or conditions that by their nature should survive such termination will survive,

                        related to this Agreement. In addition, you agree that Bliro may have any of its obligations
                        performed through an affiliate of Bliro, provided that Bliro will remain responsible for its
                        obligations hereunder and will be liable for such affiliate’s performance as if it were Bliro.

                        consent to such amendment. Bliro will inform you about your right to object and the consequences
                        of non-objection in such notice. Subject to the foregoing, no amendment or modification to this
